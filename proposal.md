## Proposed Project

I want to make a webpage where I can choose
to play checkers, chess, or Stratego (http://www.stratego.com/en/play/stratego-rules/).
My real goal is to make Stratego, but I feel I should step through the games in
the order above because each game will be more complex than the last.  In
this way I can use the experience of making the previous game in making the next.
Also making an app that can launch different games seems more ambitious and fun.
The interface for all of them would be with a crude, clickable, graphical representation 
on a grid.  I'll try my best to polish it up though.

NOTE: I fully expect to finish the checkers and chess parts but I'm still
uncertain of being able to implement Stratego in case of unforeseen obstacles.
I may submit a version with checkers and chess implemented and another version
with my best attempt at Stratego.

Question: I wonder if it would be better to focus on adding extra features to 
the chess and checkers games rather than going for base implementation for the
3 games?


## Outline Structure

I'm using the Phoenix Framework for the webpage and the code structure
will need to follow it's standards. The buttons to create a game will 
launch a supervisor that will manage the state and game process
much like the KV exercise in class.  I should have enough modules and
certainly enough lines of code with two to three games.
